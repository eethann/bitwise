BITWISE

A stochastic bitwise sequencer
intended for live play.

UI is split into two pages: 
GATES and NOTES

ALL PAGES
* k1: exit
* e1: select page
* e2: select control
* [+ k1]: change probability

GATES PAGE controls
* OPERATOR:
  * k2 [+ k1]: and [nand]
  * k3 [+ k1]: or [xor]
  * e3: l/r rotate both
  * [+ k1]:[oposite directions]
* GATE BYTE:
  * k3 [+ k1]: not [reflect TODO] 
  * e3: l/r rotate
  * [+ k1]: l/r shift
  * [+ k2]: +/- value
  * [+ k1 k2]: +/- upper nibble

NOTES PAGE controls
* Each BIT SEQUENCE BYTE
  * k2 [+ k1]: not [momentary] 
  * k3 [ + k1]: reflect [momentary]
  * e3: l/r rotate
  * [+ k1]: l/r shift
  * [+ k2]: +/- value
  * [+ k1 k2]: +/- upper nibble

MORE INFO:

GATES for each step are 
generated by combining two 
bytes with the chosen 
bitwise operator.

NOTES for each step are 
calculated by construcing 
a 4 bit value out of the 
current bit for each of 4 
bytes (one for each power 
of 2).

All controls can have a 
probability. For any byte, 
the probability is the 
likelihood that a 1 bit is 
actually on. 
For the operator the 
probability chooses between 
the op and its logical 
inverse.

TODO
* Check all funcs against docs
* POST
* EC: implement grid
* Clean up single-bit gate calc
* replace most state vars with params
* title all pages ?
